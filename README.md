# Video Streaming Service
I always wanted to work on Scalable System Design architecture. This application is a starter to that milestone to achieve. This is an app as a clone to Netflix video streaming app.

# Motivation

To serve user's with better user experience while straming through a video is the main concept idea of my video streaming app.

# Features I want to include:
1. View a video with ->0 buffer latency user experience
2. Recommend for video based on authenticated user's choice / activity / taste
3. Adding video resource to the site by authenticated users

# Architecture Design
1. Microservice
2. Saga Pattern / Even Driven System Design
3. kafka Message broker
4. Redis cache Server
3. DynamoDb
